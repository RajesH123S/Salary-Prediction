# Salary Prediction Project

This project aims to predict salaries based on various input features using a trained machine learning model.

## Project Overview
Salary prediction is essential for job seekers, employers, and analysts to estimate salaries based on experience, education, and other factors. This repository contains a trained model and dataset to facilitate such predictions.

## Files in This Repository
- **Salary Data (1).csv**: Contains salary-related data used for training and evaluation.
- **Salary Prediction.ml**: A trained machine learning model used for salary prediction.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>=3.7)
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `joblib`

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/salary-prediction.git
   cd salary-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
2. Load the trained model.
3. Use the model to make predictions based on new inputs.

### Example Code
```python
import pandas as pd
import joblib

# Load dataset
salary_data = pd.read_csv("Salary Data (1).csv")

# Load trained model
model = joblib.load("Salary Prediction.ml")

# Predict salary for a sample input
sample_input = [[5, 1, 70000]]  # Example features: years of experience, education level, current salary
y_pred = model.predict(sample_input)
print("Predicted Salary:", y_pred)
```
